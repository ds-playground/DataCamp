In this Chapter, you'll learn how to write simple functions, as well as functions that accept multiple arguments and return multiple values.

Unlike with numeric types such as ints and floats, the `+` operator concatenates strings together, while the `*` concatenates multiple copies of a string together. In this exercise, you will use the `+` and `*` operations on strings to answer the question below. Execute the following code in the shell:\n",
